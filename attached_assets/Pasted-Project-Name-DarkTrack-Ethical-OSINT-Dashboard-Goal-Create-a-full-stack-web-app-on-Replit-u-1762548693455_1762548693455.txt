Project Name: DarkTrack — Ethical OSINT Dashboard

Goal:
Create a full-stack web app on Replit (using Flask + TailwindCSS) called “DarkTrack”.
This app lets users securely log in with GitHub, Google, or Apple, and view an AI-driven dashboard that analyzes how their data appears across the internet.

Theme:
Built for the Replit Vibeathon 2025 (Agentverse track).
Focus on building an intelligent, autonomous OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) agent that plans, executes, and reports findings automatically.

Core Requirements:
1. **Authentication**
   - Login or signup page with options to sign in via GitHub, Google, or Apple ID.
   - After login, redirect to user dashboard.
   - Store basic user info (name, email, id) in session.
   - Logout option.

2. **Dashboard**
   - Display global data of the user: where their data appears online (using APIs like HaveIBeenPwned, GitHub, WHOIS lookup, etc.).
   - Show summary metrics:
     - Number of breaches found.
     - Profiles detected (e.g., GitHub, Twitter).
     - Overall security risk score (0–100).
     - Secured data percentage (inverse of risk).
   - Clean, dark-themed dashboard UI using TailwindCSS.

3. **AI Analysis**
   - AI agent should analyze the fetched data and automatically:
     - Detect which data is breached, exposed, or at risk.
     - Predict which data *could become vulnerable* based on patterns.
     - Offer to provide “steps to secure” that data.
     - Ask the user whether to view or receive the recommendations.

4. **Reports**
   - Display a visual report summarizing:
     - “Data in Danger”
     - “Data Potentially at Risk”
     - “Secured Data”
   - Add an option to generate a downloadable PDF summary.
   - Show an overall “Digital Safety Score” and progress bar.

5. **Backend Logic**
   - Use Flask routes:
     - `/` → login page
     - `/dashboard` → user dashboard
     - `/api/scan` → API endpoint that runs the OSINT agent
   - Create an `osint_agent.py` module to:
     - Query public APIs.
     - Aggregate results.
     - Compute risk and secured data ratio.
     - Generate an AI-based summary and recommendations.
   - Use Replit DB for storing past scans and analytics.

6. **Design**
   - Sleek dark mode design with neon blue highlights.
   - Dashboard layout: Left side → input/search; Right side → visual results.
   - Use Tailwind for styling and Chart.js or Plotly for charts.
   - Keep it mobile responsive.

7. **AI Integration**
   - Include a reasoning engine or AI summarizer that interprets raw data and produces insights like:
     “Your email was found in 2 breaches. Risk level: Medium. Suggested action: Change your password and enable 2FA.”
   - If Replit AI Agent is available, integrate it for generating natural-language recommendations.

8. **Ethical and Privacy Rules**
   - Use only public OSINT data (no private scraping).
   - Don’t store sensitive info permanently.
   - Include a disclaimer: “DarkTrack uses public data sources and does not access private information.”

Deliverables:
- A functioning Flask app hosted on Replit with working login, dashboard, API scanning, and AI suggestions.
- TailwindCSS styled UI and responsive dashboard.
- Short README.md describing the purpose, APIs, and ethical OSINT scope.

Judging Focus:
- Autonomy: The AI agent acts and analyzes automatically.
- Intelligence: It provides real-time recommendations.
- Creativity: Elegant dashboard and visualization.
- Replit Integration: Uses Replit DB, AI, and deployment.

Tone and Style:
Keep it professional, minimalistic, and production-ready.
Focus on usability, data visualization, and secure design.
